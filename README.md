 *Project Description
 
This project is a responsive and interactive web-based weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather information from a public API. Built using core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to enter the name of any city and receive up-to-date weather details such as temperature and weather conditions like "clear sky", "rain", or "cloudy".
The main aim of the project is to demonstrate how API integration can be used in front-end web development to dynamically retrieve and display data from external sources. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API, which is a free and widely used public API for real-time weather data.

*Tools & Technologies Used

1.HTML5: For the structure of the web page.

2.CSS3: For basic styling and layout (can be further improved with frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap).

3.JavaScript (ES6): For fetching API data, handling events, and updating the DOM dynamically.

4.OpenWeatherMap API: Public RESTful API used to get weather data based on user input.

5.Visual Studio Code: The code editor used to write and debug this project.

6.Live Server Extension (VS Code): Used to launch a local development server with live reload support

*How It Works
 
1.User Interface:

The webpage presents an input box for the user to enter a city name.

A button labeled "Check Weather" initiates the API request when clicked.

2.JavaScript Functionality:

Once the user inputs a city name and clicks the button, a fetch() request is made to the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided API key.

The weather data is received in JSON format.

The JavaScript code then parses the response and extracts relevant information (like temperature and description).

This information is displayed dynamically on the webpage below the button.

3.Error Handling:

If no input is provided, an error message is shown asking the user to enter a city.

If the API returns an error (e.g., "city not found"), a meaningful error message is shown to the user.
